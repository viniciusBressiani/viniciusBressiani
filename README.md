## Hi I'm Vinicius <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

I'm Vinicius Bressiani a Full Stack Developer.

I have been an entrepreneur since 2003, I have had businesses in the field of catering, commerce, e-commerce and entertainment. In 2017 I decided to invest more in myself (having more life experiences) and took a 3-year road trip across the American and European continents. In 2019 I started to provide services in the IT area for Escola Superior de Cerveja e Malte and identified myself with the field of software engineering. I'm still learning a lot as I work. I've been dividing my time between work and studies for two years now, I've participated in several courses and training sessions and carried out many projects at ESCM.
Today I have experience in frontend and backend, I started studying with Java, I made some programs with Python, but I have been working more with JavaScript. I use React, Redux, Nodejs and some language libraries.
